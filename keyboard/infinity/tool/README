OpenOCD config files for Kinetis 
================================
http://nemuisan.blog.bai.ne.jp/?eid=192848#OPENOCD

These are needed for debug and programing bootloader with SWD. To flash keyboard firmware use 'dfu-util'.

Flash security of Freescale kinetis
-----------------------------------
If FSEC of flash config is changed accidentally SWD/JTAG you can't get debug access until doing 'mdm mass_erase' with JTAG, CMSIS-DAP or OpenSAD adapter. HLA(high level adapter) like stlink doesn't work for this.


Example
-------
Debug:
    $ openocd -s tool -f tool/openocd.cfg
    $ arm-none-eabi-gdb build/infinity.elf -ex "target remote localhost:3333"

Flash bootloader:
    $ openocd -s tool -f tool/openocd.cfg -c "mt_flash kiibohd_bootloader.bin"


Infinity SWD pinout
-------------------
SWD pins are placed next to reset button; SWD_CLK, SWD_DIO, GND, 5V from top.
Note that RESET is also needed to get full control with OpenOCD.

             --------
            | ___  o |CLK
            ||RST| o |DIO
            ||BTN| o |GND
            | ---  o |5V
             --------
