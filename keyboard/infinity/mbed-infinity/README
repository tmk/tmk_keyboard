mbed fix for Infinity
=====================
Without linker script patch it doesn't place vector table in final binary.
And clock is configured to 48MHz using internal clock reference and FLL multiplication.


mbed/targets/cmsis/TARGET_Freescale/TARGET_K20D50M/system_MK20D5.c
    Fix SystemInit: clock setup for internal clock. Inifinity has no external Xtal.

mbed/targets/cmsis/TARGET_Freescale/TARGET_K20D50M/cmsis_nvic.c
    Fix NVIC vector address of firmware 0x1000 instead of 0x0

mbed/targets/cmsis/TARGET_Freescale/TARGET_K20D50M/TOOLCHAIN_GCC_ARM/MK20D5.ld
    Fix memory map for Infinity bootloader
        Flash starts at 0x1000
        No flash config bytes sector

USBDevice/USBDevice/USBHAL_KL25Z.cpp
    Fix USB clock setup, see below.


2015/01/04  Based on mbed-sdk @2f63fa7d78a26.



Kinetis USB config
==================
Clock source: Internal reference clock wth FLL
    SIM_SOPT[USBSRC] = 1(MCGPLLCLK/MCGFLLCLK)
    SIM_SOPT[PLLSEL] = 0(MCGFLLCLK)

Clock dividor:
    SIM_CLKDIV2[USBDIV] = 0
    SIM_CLKDIV2[USBFAC] = 0

Clock enable:
    SIM_SCGC4[USBOTG] = 1



Infinity bootloader change
==========================
After @2c7542e(2015/01) Infinity bootloader doesn't disable watchdog timer and keyboard firmware has to do it itself.  mbed disables watchdog in startup sequence but unfortunately timer is timed out bofore that.

We have to do that in earlier phase of mbed startup sequence.

WORKAROUND
----------
Call SystemInit early in Reset_Handler.
