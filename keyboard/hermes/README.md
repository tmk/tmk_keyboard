Hermes keyboard firmware
========================
DIY ortholinear 60% keyboard designed by wenbu. It has support for RGB backlighting on the PCB.

## Build
Move to this directory then just run `make` like:

    $ make

Use `make -f Makefile.pjrc` if you want to use PJRC stack but I find no reason to do so now.
