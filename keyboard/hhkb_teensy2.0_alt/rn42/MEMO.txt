Memo of deveopment
==================
just memo, NOT WORTH READING

2015/11/24
JP Bluetooth:
    RN-42 cannot send Japanese keys like; henkan, mu-henkan and kana, JPY and RO.
    It seems HID usage more than 0x65 cannot be send with the module.
        http://shiki.esrille.com/2014/07/bluetoothnisse.html


Bug:
- Factory Reset PIO4 doesn't work
    - the reason is unclear - 12/08 NOT LOOK INTO ANY MORE
    - WORKAROUND: use serial pins(3.3V, GND, RX and TX)
        - SF,1 and R,1 to set factory defalult
    

Todo:
- LED cover and switch knob and new Slide Switch
- RN42 auto configuration
    - configure the module as HID device every time powering up
    - this'll reduce work load of assembly

- move rn42 to protocol directory when it becomes reusable stack

- sendchar() in lufa.c no buffer
    - no buffering. character lost can be caused.
- LUFA sendchar should be buffered and serial_uart.c buffur size is too large(256).

- BT operations
    - disconnect
    - new connection
    - remove connection

- sendchar() in lufa.c block loop   - DONE 11/29
    - block loop when powered with AC adapter
    - FrameNumber is not updated when adapter powered

    - Enhancing ADC resolution by oversampling
        AVR121  http://www.atmel.com/images/doc8003.pdf
    - disable digital input buffer DIDR(7.8.6)

Design:
- suspend.h - DONE 11/26
    - remove argument from suspend_power_down() for backward compatitibility
- remove MCU dependent power saving code from core/keyboard - DONE 11/23
    - it should be located in project matrix.c
- HHKB matrix.c needs matrix_prev?
    - is_modified() is obsolete now. really needs?
- ADC: removing AREF capacitor C10
    - seems to be better while usb powered
    - still bad while battery powered

TROUBLE SHOOT
-------------
07/16   After fix of voltage dividor on GPIO6, had a trouble that it could not send a char to BT module, though could receive.
        Found R8 had wrong 1K resistor and changed to 10K, after that it can send to the module again. Not sure how it had sent with the wrong 1K before.

07/18   On Linux, had an USB related trouble; keyboard or console didn't work for some reason. Changing PID cured this problem. Very annoying, took very long time before resolved it.

12/07   rn42_rts() read 1 every time. R12 broke in open mode(no coductive), idk why, too much heat with soldering? and PF1 pin was not soldered.
        It resolved with resoldering PF1 and new resistor on R12.




Done:
- low battery alert(solid light) 09/04
- *** Rev.E BT test *** - DONE
    - with MCP73832, new Schottky, tantalum caps - DONE 12/07
        * MCP73832 doesn't leak from Vcc pin when unpluged and battery powered
            34mV vs 2.07V(MCP73831) at Vcc pin
            MCP73832 doesn't need revese protection diode D5
        * PMEG2010ER is very low VF while reverse current/voltage is high
            VF=0.96 vs 1.98(RB160M-30TR)with Fluke 175
            Anode of D11 is 680mV vs 20mV(RB160M-30TR)
            780mV is still low < 1.4V VBUS plugin detection(21.11)
                this doesn't cause false VBUS detect
                and 780mV on MCP73832 Vcc pin is also no problem.
            D5 can be removed.
    - ADC divider switching - DONE 12/07
        * Drain and Source of Q4 Pch was reversed wrongly on Rev.E.

- Power selector doesn't work; Q4 MOSFET leaks from Lipo to USB power line. -- use Schottky instead 07/04

- wrongly suspended when powered from adapter without USB connection - DONE
    - suspend event may occur when plug into adapter
    - and never wake until conected to real USB line
    - without debug print via USB no problem; CSW(wake just after suspend as real USB line)

    Not confirmed. 01/15

    - switch next connection
        cannot switch connection with version 6.15 at least

    - it sleeps. it should not sleep
    - Configured state without USB connection?

- timer is slow while power down - DONE 11/26
    - time out interrupt is lost while power down?
    - interrupt of watchdog timer compensates timer counter(avr/suspend.c)

- repeated CHARGING/FULL_CHARGED    - No longer problem 01/15
    - In LTC sharp pulses are observed.
    - MCP has no pulse but still has a problem.

    - it ends in suspend state
    - maybe, not responsive to host enumeration process due to power-down.

        - need to observe a while
