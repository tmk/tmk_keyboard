RN-42 Bluetooth Module Support
==============================
Bluetooth controller board works with HHKB Pro2, JP, Type-S and Type-S JP and it supports both USB and Bluetooth as keyboard output protocol. Bluetooth module Roving Networks/Microchip RN-42 is installed on the board.


RN-42:
http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=RN42


Capabitlities:
- USB keyboard functions
    completely equivarent to USB controller including mouse keys and NKRO.
- Switching between USB and Bluetooth
    You can switch the two connections with BT switch or key combination.
- RN-42 config mode
    You can change power/connection configuration of the module if needed.
- Low battery alert
    Red LED turns on when low voltage.
- RN-42 status indicator
    LED indicates status of Bluetooth connection.
- Pairing
    The module stores up to 8 connections.
- Auto connect
    The module connects the last connected device automatically.
- iOS support
    works as keyboard with iPhone5. No tested completely.
- Android support
    works as keyboard and mouse with Nexus5. No tested completely.
- Mouse keys over BT
    Note that iOS doesn't accept mouse device.


Limitations:
- Short battery life
    Around 12hr with 1000mAh
- No connection switching
    RN-42 auto-connects to the last connected device.
    Some of consumer products can switch between devices, for example Logitech K480.
        http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/multi-device-keyboard-k480?crid=26
- HHKB JP requires case modification for BT switch and LEDs.
    without switch power controlled by MCU? Probably using 3.3V regulator enable pin power of RN-42 can be controlled.

NOTE:
- LIPO BATTERY IS VERY DANGEROUS, TAKE EXTRA CARE OF YOUR SAFETY AND PROPERTY.
- RN-42 version 6.15 is supported.
- No NKRO over Bluetooth
- Check you country's wiress regulation and certification of RN-42.

Here is help.

    ----- Bluetooth RN-42 Help -----
    i:       RN-42 info
    b:       battery voltage
    Del:     enter/exit RN-42 config mode
    Slck:    RN-42 initialize
    p:       pairing
    u:       toggle Force USB mode

    RN-42 info:             displays information of the module on console.
    battery voltage:        displays current voltage of battery and uptime.
    RN-42 initialize:       does factory reset and configures RN-42
    pairing:                enters Pairing mode.
    toggle Force USB mode:  switch between USB and Bluetooth


RN-42 Config mode
-----------------
You can tune/operate RN-42 yourself with config(command) mode.

1. hook up USB cable
2. run `hid_listen` command  in console
3. turn on Bluetooth switch
4. press LShift+RShift+Delete(Fn+~) you will see output like followings:

    Entering config mode ...
    CMD
    v

5. do config with RN-42 commands. See documentations of RN-42.
6. to exit also press LShift+RShift+Delete(Fn+~)

    Exiting config mode ...
    ---
    END


RN-42 Initial Configuration
---------------------------
RN-42 is configured as SPP device at factory reset, you need to configure it as HID device. This is needed just once first time.

1. hook up USB cable
2. run `hid_listen` command  in console
3. turn on Bluetooth switch
4. press LShift+RShift+ScrLk(Fn+O) you will see output like followings:

    Entering config mode ...

For deveropment
===============

RN-42 Serial Connection
-----------------------
UART:           115200bps, 8bit, 1-stopbit, non-parity, no flow control
SSP:            115200bps, 8bit, 1-stopbit, non-parity, no flow control(via Bluetooth)

To enter command mode disconnect the module from host and type '$$$'.(you will see 'CMD') and type '+' to get local echo. To exit type '---'(you will see 'END').


RN-42 Commands
--------------

SM,6                // Pairing mode: auto connect
SM,4                // Master mode: Connection can be controled with GPIO6
SF,1                // Factroy reset
R,1                 // reboot
SR,Z                // removes all remote addresses for reconnecting.
                    // can be used to connect another host
SR,I                // registers last inquiry address


Operation Modes
---------------
SM,3        Auto Connect Master mode
SM,4        Auto Connect DTR Mode uses GPIO6 to make and break connection(Mode =DTR)
                confirm: auto connect works and control connection with GPIO6
SM,5        Auto Connect ANY Mode (Mode =ANY)
                each time GPIO is set, make inquiry and connect to the first found device
SM,6        automatically reconnect(Mode =Pair)
                confirm: auto connect works well but difficult to enter command mode.

Apple iOS
---------
Keyboard can be used with iPhone, but mouse cannot.


Android
-------
3.7.1.5 Note: To connect with Android phone the modules must wake up 11ms every 2.5seconds.


Power Management
----------------
Inquiry and Page window     Idle or Active  (3.1.1)
    Downside: delay in discovery or connection time
    SI,         // set inquiry scan window(discovery) on/off duty?
    SJ,         // set page scan window(connection)
    This reduces averaege power >20mA to 5mA(3mA in Sniff mode)

Sniff mode                  Transmit
    Sniff mode is disabled by default and radio is active continuously when connected.(25-30mA)
    In Sniff mode the radio wakes up intermittently and sleeps in very low power mode.(2mA)
    SW,<val>    // set interval timer(*0.625ms) 0000-7FFF

Deep sleep                  Idle            (3.1.2)
    In this mode the module shuts down completly and only draws about 300uA. To enable this set the most signifant bit(0x8000) of Sniff interaval timer.
    SW,8320     // deep sleep enable(interval=0x320*0.625=500ms)
    In normal sleep the firmware is still running in idle mode, and wakes up about 20 times per second to check ports, update LEDs, etc. During deep sleep, the firmware actually stops runnig some tasks and the LEDs only update about once per second.
    To wake from deep sleep there are three ways: (in worst case wake up takes 5ms)
        *send a charactor to the UART(first charactor will be lost)
        *toggle CTS low to high and wait 5ms
        *wake automatically every slot time(<val>*0.625ms)
    Once the radio is awake it stay active for exactly 1 second of inactivity and then sleeps again.
    Downside: latency and data loss

Disable Output driver       Idle or Active  (3.1.3)
    S%,1000     // set all GPIO pins(0-11) to inputs.

Lower Transmit Power        Idle or Active  (3.1.4)
    SY,<hex>    // transmit power setting(takes effect after a power cycle and reboot)
    Downside: reducing effective range


Optimizig for Latency
---------------------
By default the firmware is optimized for throughput.
SQ,16           // set latency bit
SQ,0            // unset latency bit


Configuration timer settings
----------------------------
Remote configuration is used for the module to be configured with various commands over Bluetooth(SPP profile only?).

The module has remote configuration timer to allow remote configuration over Bluetooth after power up in Slave mode. In Master modes the remote configuration timer is set to 0(no remote configuration). (In Trigger Master mode the timer is used as an idle timer to break the connection after time expires with no charactors receive.)
    ST,0        // no remote, no local when connected
    ST,<1-252>  // local and remote with timeout in seconds from power up
    ST,253      // local only       without timeout
    ST,254      // remote only      without timeout
    ST,255      // local and remote without timeout
