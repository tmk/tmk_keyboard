LilyPadUSB bootloader code

the Leonardo. To enter the bootloader, the user should execute TWO external resets within 750 ms; that is,
press the reset button twice, quickly.\

Some other changes were made to allow this code to compile tightly enough to fit in the alloted 4k of

//  checked, the check doesn't fail and fall through to the bootloader unnecessarily.

// The second, more in depth modification addresses behavior after an external reset (i.e.,
//  user pushes the reset button). The Leonardo treats all external resets as requests to
//  re-enter the bootloader and wait for code to be loaded. It remains in bootloader mode for
//  8 seconds before continuing on to the sketch (if one is present). By defining RESET_DELAY
//  equal to 1, this behavior will persist.

// However, if RESET_DELAY is defined to 0, the reset timeout before loading the sketch drops
//  to 750ms. If, during that 750ms, another external reset occurs, THEN an 8-second delay
