This file documents changes in the firmware-only USB driver for atmel's AVR
microcontrollers. New entries are always appended to the end of the file.
Scroll down to the bottom to see the most recent changes.

2005-04-01:
  - Implemented endpoint 1 as interrupt-in endpoint.
  - Moved all configuration options to usbconfig.h which is not part of the
    driver.
  - Changed interface for usbVendorSetup().
  - Fixed compatibility with ATMega8 device.
  - Various minor optimizations.

2005-04-11:
  - Changed interface to application: Use usbFunctionSetup(), usbFunctionRead()
    and usbFunctionWrite() now. Added configuration options to choose which
    of these functions to compile in.
  - Assembler module delivers receive data non-inverted now.
  - Made register and bit names compatible with more AVR devices.

2005-05-03:
  - Allow address of usbRxBuf on any memory page as long as the buffer does
    not cross 256 byte page boundaries.
  - Better device compatibility: works with Mega88 now.
  - Code optimization in debugging module.
  - Documentation updates.

2006-01-02:
  - Added (free) default Vendor- and Product-IDs bought from voti.nl.
  - Added USBID-License.txt file which defines the rules for using the free
    shared VID/PID pair.
  - Added Readme.txt to the usbdrv directory which clarifies administrative
    issues.

2006-01-25:
  - Added "configured state" to become more standards compliant.
  - Added "HALT" state for interrupt endpoint.
  - Driver passes the "USB Command Verifier" test from usb.org now.
  - Made "serial number" a configuration option.
  - Minor optimizations, we now recommend compiler option "-Os" for best
    results.
  - Added a version number to usbdrv.h

2006-02-03:
  - New configuration variable USB_BUFFER_SECTION for the memory section where
    the USB rx buffer will go. This defaults to ".bss" if not defined. Since
    this buffer MUST NOT cross 256 byte pages (not even touch a page at the
    end), the user may want to pass a linker option similar to
    "-Wl,--section-start=.mybuffer=0x800060".
  - Provide structure for usbRequest_t.
  - New defines for USB constants.
  - Prepared for HID implementations.
  - Increased data size limit for interrupt transfers to 8 bytes.
  - New macro usbInterruptIsReady() to query interrupt buffer state.

2006-02-18:
  - Ensure that the data token which is sent as an ack to an OUT transfer is
    always zero sized. This fixes a bug where the host reports an error after
    sending an out transfer to the device, although all data arrived at the
    device.
  - Updated docs in usbdrv.h to reflect changed API in usbFunctionWrite().

* Release 2006-02-20

  - Give a compiler warning when compiling with debugging turned on.
  - Added Oleg Semyonov's changes for IAR-cc compatibility.
  - Added new (optional) functions usbDeviceConnect() and usbDeviceDisconnect()
    (also thanks to Oleg!).
  - Rearranged tests in usbPoll() to save a couple of instructions in the most
    likely case that no actions are pending.
  - We need a delay between the SET ADDRESS request until the new address
    becomes active. This delay was handled in usbPoll() until now. Since the
    spec says that the delay must not exceed 2ms, previous versions required
    aggressive polling during the enumeration phase. We have now moved the
    handling of the delay into the interrupt routine.
  - We must not reply with NAK to a SETUP transaction. We can only achieve this
    by making sure that the rx buffer is empty when SETUP tokens are expected.
    We therefore don't pass zero sized data packets from the status phase of
    a transfer to usbPoll(). This change MAY cause troubles if you rely on
    receiving a less than 8 bytes long packet in usbFunctionWrite() to
    identify the end of a transfer. usbFunctionWrite() will NEVER be called
    with a zero length.

* Release 2006-03-14

  - Improved IAR C support: tiny memory model, more devices
  - Added template usbconfig.h file under the name usbconfig-prototype.h

* Release 2006-03-26

  - Added provision for one more interrupt-in endpoint (endpoint 3).
  - Added provision for one interrupt-out endpoint (endpoint 1).
  - Added flowcontrol macros for USB.
  - Added provision for custom configuration descriptor.
  - Allow ANY two port bits for D+ and D-.
  - Merged (optional) receive endpoint number into global usbRxToken variable.
  - Use USB_CFG_IOPORTNAME instead of USB_CFG_IOPORT. We now construct the
    variable name from the single port letter instead of computing the address
    of related ports from the output-port address.

* Release 2006-06-26

  - Updated documentation in usbdrv.h and usbconfig-prototype.h to reflect the
    new features.
  - Removed "#warning" directives because IAR does not understand them. Use
    unused static variables instead to generate a warning.
  - Do not include <avr/io.h> when compiling with IAR.
  - Introduced USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_* in usbconfig.h to configure how each
    USB descriptor should be handled. It is now possible to provide descriptor
    data in Flash, RAM or dynamically at runtime.
  - STALL is now a status in usbTxLen* instead of a message. We can now conform
    to the spec and leave the stall status pending until it is cleared.
  - Made usbTxPacketCnt1 and usbTxPacketCnt3 public. This allows the
    application code to reset data toggling on interrupt pipes.

* Release 2006-07-18

  - Added an #if !defined __ASSEMBLER__ to the warning in usbdrv.h. This fixes
    an assembler error.
  - usbDeviceDisconnect() takes pull-up resistor to high impedance now.

* Release 2007-02-01

  - Merged in some code size improvements from usbtiny (thanks to Dick
    Streefland for these optimizations!)
  - Special alignment requirement for usbRxBuf not required any more. Thanks
    again to Dick Streefland for this hint!
  - Reverted to "#warning" instead of unused static variables -- new versions
    of IAR CC should handle this directive.
  - Changed Open Source license to GNU GPL v2 in order to make linking against
    other free libraries easier. We no longer require publication of the
    circuit diagrams, but we STRONGLY encourage it. If you improve the driver
    itself, PLEASE grant us a royalty free license to your changes for our
    commercial license.

* Release 2007-03-29

  - New configuration option "USB_PUBLIC" in usbconfig.h.
  - Set USB version number to 1.10 instead of 1.01.
  - Code used USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_DEVICE and
    USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_PRODUCT inconsistently. Changed all occurrences
    to USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_PRODUCT.
  - New assembler module for 16.5 MHz RC oscillator clock with PLL in receiver
    code.
  - New assembler module for 16 MHz crystal.
  - usbdrvasm.S contains common code only, clock-specific parts have been moved
    to usbdrvasm12.S, usbdrvasm16.S and usbdrvasm165.S respectively.

* Release 2007-06-25

  - 16 MHz module: Do SE0 check in stuffed bits as well.

* Release 2007-07-07

  - Define hi8(x) for IAR compiler to limit result to 8 bits. This is necessary
    for negative values.
  - Added 15 MHz module contributed by V. Bosch.
  - Interrupt vector name can now be configured. This is useful if somebody
    wants to use a different hardware interrupt than INT0.

* Release 2007-08-07

  - Moved handleIn3 routine in usbdrvasm16.S so that relative jump range is
    not exceeded.
  - More config options: USB_RX_USER_HOOK(), USB_INITIAL_DATATOKEN,
    USB_COUNT_SOF
  - USB_INTR_PENDING can now be a memory address, not just I/O

* Release 2007-09-19

  - Split out common parts of assembler modules into separate include file
  - Made endpoint numbers configurable so that given interface definitions
    can be matched. See USB_CFG_EP3_NUMBER in usbconfig-prototype.h.
  - Store endpoint number for interrupt/bulk-out so that usbFunctionWriteOut()
    can handle any number of endpoints.
  - Define usbDeviceConnect() and usbDeviceDisconnect() even if no
    USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORTNAME is defined. Directly set D+ and D- to 0 in this
    case.

* Release 2007-12-01

  - Optimize usbDeviceConnect() and usbDeviceDisconnect() for less code size
    when USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORTNAME is not defined.

* Release 2007-12-13

  - Renamed all include-only assembler modules from *.S to *.inc so that
    people don't add them to their project sources.
  - Distribute leap bits in tx loop more evenly for 16 MHz module.
  - Use "macro" and "endm" instead of ".macro" and ".endm" for IAR
  - Avoid compiler warnings for constant expr range by casting some values in
    USB descriptors.

* Release 2008-01-21

  - Fixed bug in 15 and 16 MHz module where the new address set with
    SET_ADDRESS was already accepted at the next NAK or ACK we send, not at
    the next data packet we send. This caused problems when the host polled
    too fast. Thanks to Alexander Neumann for his help and patience debugging
    this issue!

* Release 2008-02-05

  - Fixed bug in 16.5 MHz module where a register was used in the interrupt
    handler before it was pushed. This bug was introduced with version
    2007-09-19 when common parts were moved to a separate file.
  - Optimized CRC routine (thanks to Reimar Doeffinger).

* Release 2008-02-16

  - Removed outdated IAR compatibility stuff (code sections).
  - Added hook macros for USB_RESET_HOOK() and USB_SET_ADDRESS_HOOK().
  - Added optional routine usbMeasureFrameLength() for calibration of the
    internal RC oscillator.

* Release 2008-02-28

  - USB_INITIAL_DATATOKEN defaults to USBPID_DATA1 now, which means that we
    start with sending USBPID_DATA0.
  - Changed defaults in usbconfig-prototype.h
  - Added free USB VID/PID pair for MIDI class devices
  - Restructured AVR-USB as separate package, not part of PowerSwitch any more.

* Release 2008-04-18

  - Restructured usbdrv.c so that it is easier to read and understand.
  - Better code optimization with gcc 4.
  - If a second interrupt in endpoint is enabled, also add it to config
    descriptor.
  - Added config option for long transfers (above 254 bytes), see
    USB_CFG_LONG_TRANSFERS in usbconfig.h.
  - Added 20 MHz module contributed by Jeroen Benschop.

* Release 2008-05-13

  - Fixed bug in libs-host/hiddata.c function usbhidGetReport(): length
    was not incremented, pointer to length was incremented instead.
  - Added code to command line tool(s) which claims an interface. This code
    is disabled by default, but may be necessary on newer Linux kernels.
  - Added usbconfig.h option "USB_CFG_CHECK_DATA_TOGGLING".
  - New header "usbportability.h" prepares ports to other development
    environments.
  - Long transfers (above 254 bytes) did not work when usbFunctionRead() was
    used to supply the data. Fixed this bug. [Thanks to Alexander Neumann!]
  - In hiddata.c (example code for sending/receiving data over HID), use
    USB_RECIP_DEVICE instead of USB_RECIP_INTERFACE for control transfers so
    that we need not claim the interface.
  - in usbPoll() loop 20 times polling for RESET state instead of 10 times.
    This accounts for the higher clock rates we now support.
  - Added a module for 12.8 MHz RC oscillator with PLL in receiver loop.
  - Added hook to SOF code so that oscillator can be tuned to USB frame clock.
  - Added timeout to waitForJ loop. Helps preventing unexpected hangs.
  - Added example code for oscillator tuning to libs-device (thanks to
    Henrik Haftmann for the idea to this routine).
  - Implemented option USB_CFG_SUPPRESS_INTR_CODE.

* Release 2008-10-22

  - Fixed libs-device/osctune.h: OSCCAL is memory address on ATMega88 and
    similar, not offset of 0x20 needs to be added.
  - Allow distribution under GPLv3 for those who have to link against other
    code distributed under GPLv3.

* Release 2008-11-26

  - Removed libusb-win32 dependency for hid-data example in Makefile.windows.
    It was never required and confused many people.
  - Added extern uchar usbRxToken to usbdrv.h.
  - Integrated a module with CRC checks at 18 MHz by Lukas Schrittwieser.

* Release 2009-03-23

  - Hid-mouse example used settings from hid-data example, fixed that.
  - Renamed project to V-USB due to a trademark issue with Atmel(r).
  - Changed CommercialLicense.txt and USBID-License.txt to make the
    background of USB ID registration clearer.

* Release 2009-04-15

  - Changed CommercialLicense.txt to reflect the new range of PIDs from
    Jason Kotzin.
  - Removed USBID-License.txt in favor of USB-IDs-for-free.txt and
    USB-ID-FAQ.txt
  - Fixed a bug in the 12.8 MHz module: End Of Packet decection was made in
    the center between bit 0 and 1 of each byte. This is where the data lines
    are expected to change and the sampled data may therefore be nonsense.
    We therefore check EOP ONLY if bits 0 AND 1 have both been read as 0 on D-.
  - Fixed a bitstuffing problem in the 16 MHz module: If bit 6 was stuffed,
    the unstuffing code in the receiver routine was 1 cycle too long. If
    multiple bytes had the unstuffing in bit 6, the error summed up until the
    receiver was out of sync.
  - Included option for faster CRC routine.
    Thanks to Slawomir Fras (BoskiDialer) for this code!
  - Updated bits in Configuration Descriptor's bmAttributes according to
    USB 1.1 (in particular bit 7, it is a must-be-set bit now).

* Release 2009-08-22

  - Moved first DBG1() after odDebugInit() in all examples.
  - Use vector INT0_vect instead of SIG_INTERRUPT0 if defined. This makes
    V-USB compatible with the new "p" suffix devices (e.g. ATMega328p).
  - USB_CFG_CLOCK_KHZ setting is now required in usbconfig.h (no default any
    more).
  - New option USB_CFG_DRIVER_FLASH_PAGE allows boot loaders on devices with
    more than 64 kB flash.
  - Built-in configuration descriptor allows custom definition for second
    endpoint now.

* Release 2010-07-15
