FREE USB-IDs FOR SHARED USE
===========================

Objective Development has reserved a set of USB Product-IDs for use according
to the guidelines outlined below. For more information about the concept of
USB IDs please see the file USB-ID-FAQ.txt. Objective Development guarantees
that the IDs listed below are not used by any USB compliant devices.


====================
MECHANISM OF SHARING
====================

From a technical point of view, two different devices can share the same USB
Vendor- and Product-ID if they require the same driver on operating system
level. We make use of this fact by assigning separate IDs for various device
classes. On application layer, devices must be distinguished by their textual
name or serial number. We offer separate sets of IDs for discrimination by
textual name and for serial number.

Examples for shared use of USB IDs are included with V-USB in the "examples"
subdirectory.


======================================
IDs FOR DISCRIMINATION BY TEXTUAL NAME
======================================

If you use one of the IDs listed below, your device and host-side software
must conform to these rules:

(1) The USB device MUST provide a textual representation of the manufacturer
and product identification. The manufacturer identification MUST be available
at least in USB language 0x0409 (English/US).

(2) The textual manufacturer identification MUST contain either an Internet
domain name (e.g. "mycompany.com") registered and owned by you, or an e-mail
address under your control (e.g. "myname@gmx.net"). You can embed the domain
name or e-mail address in any string you like, e.g.  "Objective Development
http://www.obdev.at/vusb/".

(3) You are responsible for retaining ownership of the domain or e-mail
address for as long as any of your products are in use.

(4) You may choose any string for the textual product identification, as long
as this string is unique within the scope of your textual manufacturer
identification.

(5) Application side device look-up MUST be based on the textual manufacturer
and product identification in addition to VID/PID matching. The driver
matching MUST be a comparison of the entire strings, NOT a sub-string match.

(6) For devices which implement a particular USB device class (e.g. HID), the
operating system's default class driver MUST be used. If an operating system
driver for Vendor Class devices is needed, this driver must be libusb or
libusb-win32 (see http://libusb.org/ and
http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net/).

Table if IDs for discrimination by textual name:

PID dec (hex) | VID dec (hex) | Description of use
==============+===============+============================================
1500 (0x05dc) | 5824 (0x16c0) | For Vendor Class devices with libusb
--------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------
1503 (0x05df) | 5824 (0x16c0) | For generic HID class devices (which are
              |               | NOT mice, keyboards or joysticks)
--------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------
1505 (0x05e1) | 5824 (0x16c0) | For CDC-ACM class devices (modems)
--------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------
1508 (0x05e4) | 5824 (0x16c0) | For MIDI class devices
--------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------

Note that Windows caches the textual product- and vendor-description for
mice, keyboards and joysticks. Name-bsed discrimination is therefore not
recommended for these device classes.


=======================================
IDs FOR DISCRIMINATION BY SERIAL NUMBER
=======================================

If you use one of the IDs listed below, your device and host-side software
must conform to these rules:

(1) The USB device MUST provide a textual representation of the serial
number. The serial number string MUST be available at least in USB language
0x0409 (English/US).

(2) The serial number MUST start with either an Internet domain name (e.g.
"mycompany.com") registered and owned by you, or an e-mail address under your
control (e.g. "myname@gmx.net"), both terminated with a colon (":") character.
You MAY append any string you like for further discrimination of your devices.

(3) You are responsible for retaining ownership of the domain or e-mail
address for as long as any of your products are in use.

(5) Application side device look-up MUST be based on the serial number string
in addition to VID/PID matching. The matching must start at the first
character of the serial number string and include the colon character
terminating your domain or e-mail address. It MAY stop anywhere after that.

(6) For devices which implement a particular USB device class (e.g. HID), the
operating system's default class driver MUST be used. If an operating system
driver for Vendor Class devices is needed, this driver must be libusb or
libusb-win32 (see http://libusb.org/ and
http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net/).
