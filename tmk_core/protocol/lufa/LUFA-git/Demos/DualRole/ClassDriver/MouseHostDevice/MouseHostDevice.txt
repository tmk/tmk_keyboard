 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Mouse host/device dual role demonstration application. This gives a simple
 *  reference application for implementing a dual role USB Mouse, for USB mice
 *  using the standard mouse boot protocol HID profile.
 *
 *  <b>When in host mode:</b>
 *  Mouse movement and button presses are displayed on the board LEDs,
 *  as well as printed out the serial terminal as formatted dY, dY and
 *  button status information.
 *
 *  This uses a naive method where the mouse is set to Boot Protocol mode, so
 *  that the report structure is fixed and known. A better implementation
 *  uses the HID report parser for correct report data processing across
 *  all compatible mice with advanced characteristics, as shown in the
 *  MouseHostWithParser Host demo application.
 *
 *  Currently only single interface mice are supported.
 *
 *  <b>When in device mode:</b>
 *  Upon enumeration the system will automatically enumerate and function
 *  as a mouse when the USB connection to a host is present. To use
 *  the mouse, move the joystick to move the pointer, and push the
 *  joystick inwards to simulate a left-button click. The HWB serves as
 *  the right mouse button.
 *
