 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Combined Communications Device Class/Mouse demonstration application.
 *  This gives a simple reference application for implementing a combined
 *  CDC and HID device acting as a both a virtual serial port and a mouse.
 *  Joystick actions are transmitted to the host as strings and as mouse
 *  movements. The device does not respond to serial data sent from the host.
 *
 *  After running this demo for the first time on a new computer,
 *  you will need to supply the .INF file located in this demo
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under
 *  Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other
 *  Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt
 *  CDC-ACM drivers.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
