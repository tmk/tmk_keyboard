 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Keyboard/Mouse demonstration application, using a single HID interface. This gives
 *  a simple reference application for implementing a multiple HID report device
 *  containing both USB Keyboard and USB Mouse functionality using the basic USB HID
 *  drivers in all modern OSes (i.e. no special drivers required). This example uses a
 *  single HID interface that is shared between the two functions.
 *
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function as a keyboard when
 *  the USB connection to a host is present and the HWB is not pressed. When enabled,
 *  manipulate the joystick to send the letters a, b, c, d and e. See the USB HID
 *  documentation for more information on sending keyboard event and key presses.
 *
 *  When the HWB is pressed, the mouse mode is enabled. When enabled, move the joystick
 *  to move the pointer, and push the joystick inwards to simulate a left-button click.
