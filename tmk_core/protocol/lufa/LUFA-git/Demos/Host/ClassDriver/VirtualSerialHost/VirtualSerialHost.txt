 *
 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  CDC host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference application
 *  for implementing a USB CDC host, for CDC devices using the standard ACM profile.
 *
 *  This demo prints out received CDC data through the serial port.
 *
 *  Note that this demo is only compatible with devices which report the correct CDC
 *  and ACM class, subclass and protocol values. Most USB-Serial cables have vendor
 *  specific features, thus use vendor-specific class/subclass/protocol codes to force
 *  the user to use specialized drivers. This demo is not compatible with such devices.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>
 *     None
 *    </td>
 *   </tr>
