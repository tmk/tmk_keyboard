 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Mouse host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Mouse host, for USB mice using
 *  the standard mouse HID profile.
 *
 *  Mouse movement and button presses are displayed on the board LEDs,
 *  as well as printed out the serial terminal as formatted dY, dY and
 *  button status information.
 *
 *  This uses a naive method where the mouse is set to Boot Protocol mode, so
 *  that the report structure is fixed and known. A better implementation
 *  uses the HID report parser for correct report data processing across
 *  all compatible mice with advanced characteristics, as shown in the
 *  MouseHostWithParser demo application.
 *
 *  Currently only single interface mice are supported.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
