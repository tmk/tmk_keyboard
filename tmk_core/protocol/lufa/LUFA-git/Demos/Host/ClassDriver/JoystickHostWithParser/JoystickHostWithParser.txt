 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Joystick host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Joystick host, for USB joysticks using
 *  the standard joystick HID profile. It uses a HID parser for the HID
 *  reports, allowing for correct operation across all USB joysticks. This
 *  demo supports joysticks with a single HID report.
 *
 *  Joystick movement and button presses are displayed on the board LEDs.
 *  On connection to a USB joystick, the report items will be processed and
 *  printed as a formatted list through the USART before the joystick is
 *  fully enumerated.
 *
 *  Currently only single interface joysticks are supported.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
