 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Mass Storage host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Mass Storage host, for USB storage devices
 *  using the standard Mass Storage USB profile.
 *
 *  The first 512 bytes (boot sector) of an attached disk's memory will be dumped
 *  out of the serial port in HEX and ASCII form when it is attached to the AT90USB1287
 *  AVR. The device will then wait for HWB to be pressed, whereupon the entire ASCII contents
 *  of the disk will be dumped to the serial port.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
