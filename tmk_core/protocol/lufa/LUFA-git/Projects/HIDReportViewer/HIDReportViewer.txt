 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Firmware for a HID Report viewer. This project is designed to aid in the debugging of USB HID Hosts, where the contents of an
 *  unknown HID device's HID Report need to be examined. Once a HID device has been plugged into this application, the HID report
 *  descriptor will be parsed using the internal LUFA HID report parser, and the results dumped to the serial port in a human
 *  readable format. This output will contain information on the sizes of the reports within the device's HID interface, as well as
 *  information on each report element (size, usage, minimum/maximum values, etc.).
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
