 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Simple HTTP webserver project. This project combines the LUFA library with the uIP TCP/IP full network stack and FatFS
 *  library to create a RNDIS host capable of serving out HTTP web pages to multiple hosts simultaneously. This project
 *  demonstrates how the libraries can be combined into a robust network enabled application, with the addition of a RNDIS
 *  network device.
 *
 *  To use this project, plug the USB AVR into a computer, so that it enumerates as a standard Mass Storage and RNDIS composite
 *  device. Load HTML files onto the disk, so that they can be served out to clients -- the default file to serve should be called
 *  <i>index.htm</i>. Filenames must be in 8.3 format for them to be retrieved correctly by the webserver, and the total
 *  requested file path must be equal to or less than the maximum URI length (\see \ref Sec_Options). Supply the included INF
 *  file when requested on Windows machines to enable the RNDIS interface, and allow the files to be viewed on a standard web-browser
 *  using the IP address 10.0.0.2.
 *
 *  When attached to a RNDIS class device, such as a USB (desktop) modem, the system will enumerate the device, set the
 *  appropriate parameters needed for connectivity and begin listening for new HTTP connections on port 80 and TELNET
 *  connections on port 23. The device IP, netmask and default gateway IP must be set to values appropriate for the RNDIS
 *  device being used for this project to work if the DHCP client is disabled (see \ref Sec_Options) - otherwise, the device
 *  will query the network's DHCP server for these parameters automatically.
 *
 *  When properly configured, the webserver can be accessed from any HTTP web browser by typing in the device's statically or
 *  dynamically allocated IP address. The TELNET client can be accessed via any network socket app by connecting to the device
 *  on port 23 on the device's statically or dynamically allocated IP address.
 *
