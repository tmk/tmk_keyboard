/**
 * \defgroup uipsplit uIP TCP throughput booster hack
 * @{
 *
 * The basic uIP TCP implementation only allows each TCP connection to
 * have a single TCP segment in flight at any given time. Because of
 * the delayed ACK algorithm employed by most TCP receivers, uIP's
 * limit on the amount of in-flight TCP segments seriously reduces the
 * maximum achievable throughput for sending data from uIP.
 *
 * The uip-split module is a hack which tries to remedy this
 * situation. By splitting maximum sized outgoing TCP segments into
 * two, the delayed ACK algorithm is not invoked at TCP
 * receivers. This improves the throughput when sending data from uIP
 * by orders of magnitude.
 *
 * The uip-split module uses the uip-fw module (uIP IP packet
 * forwarding) for sending packets. Therefore, the uip-fw module must
 * be set up with the appropriate network interfaces for this module
 * to work.

 * transmitted separately. This function should be called instead of
 * the actual device driver output function, or the uip_fw_output()
 * function.
 *
 * The headers of the outgoing packet is assumed to be in the uip_buf
 * buffer and the payload is assumed to be wherever uip_appdata
 * points. The length of the outgoing packet is assumed to be in the
 * uip_len variable.
