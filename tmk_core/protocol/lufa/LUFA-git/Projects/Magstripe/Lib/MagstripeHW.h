	NOTE: The user of this include file MUST define the following macros
	prior to including the file:

	MAG_T1_CLOCK_PIN   Pin connected to Track 1 clock wire (i.e.. PORTC1)
	MAG_T1_DATA_PIN    Pin connected to Track 1 data wire (i.e.. PORTC2)
	MAG_T2_CLOCK_PIN   Pin connected to Track 2 clock wire (i.e.. PORTC3)
	MAG_T2_DATA_PIN    Pin connected to Track 2 data wire (i.e.. PORTC0)
	MAG_T3_CLOCK_PIN   Pin connected to Track 3 clock wire (i.e.. PORTC5)
	MAG_T3_DATA_PIN    Pin connected to Track 3 data wire (i.e.. PORTC6)
	MAG_CLS_PIN        Pin connected to card loaded wire (i.e.. PORTC4)
	MAG_PIN            PIN macro for the reader's port (i.e.. PINC)
	MAG_DDR            DDR macro for the reader's port (i.e.. DDRC)
	MAG_PORT           PORT macro for the reader's port (i.e.. PORTC)

	The example macros listed above assume that the Track 2 data wire is
	connected to pin 0 on port C, the Track 2 clock wire is connected to
	pin 3 on port C (similarly for Tracks 1 and 3), and the card loaded
	wire is connected to pin 4 on port C.

	If the mag-stripe reader you are using only reads one or two tracks,
	then set the clock and data pins for the tracks it doesn't read to a
	pin that is unused.  For example, on the AT90USBKey, any of the pins on
	port C that do not have wires attached will be unused since they are
	not connected to any onboard devices (such as the joystick or
	temperature sensor).

	Connecting wires to pins on different ports (i.e.. a data wire to pin 0
	on port C and a clock wire to pin 0 on port D) is currently
	unsupported.  All pins specified above must be on the same port.
