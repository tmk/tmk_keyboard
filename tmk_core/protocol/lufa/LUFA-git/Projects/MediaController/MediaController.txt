 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Media Controller project. This project implements a basic Media Control device, to signal the host to play, pause, toggle playback,
 *  mute and/or adjust the host volume, in addition to other such media commands. This project may be extended to create a dedicated
 *  media playback control device, for home media centers or other equipment. By default, some of the most commonly used playback controls
 *  are controlled by the board joystick and LEDs, however this may be altered as desired.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
