 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description
 *
 *  Firmware for an Atmel Studio/AVR Studio compatible AVRISP-MKII clone programmer. This project will enable the USB
 *  AVR series of microcontrollers to act as a clone of the official Atmel AVRISP-MKII programmer, usable within
 *  Atmel Studio/AVR Studio or with any software capable of driving a real Atmel AVRISP-MKII programmer. In its most
 *  basic form, it allows for the programming of AVR TINY, MEGA and XMEGA devices aat the programmer's VCC voltage from
 *  within Atmel Studio/AVR Studio with no special hardware other than the USB AVR and the parts needed for the USB
 *  interface. If the user desires, more advanced circuits incorporating level conversion can be made to allow for the
 *  programming of target AVRs running at a different voltage to the programmer.
 *
 *  This device spoofs Atmel's official AVRISP-MKII device PID so that it remains compatible with Atmel's AVRISP-MKII
 *  drivers. When prompted, direct your OS to install Atmel's AVRISP-MKII drivers provided with Atmel Studio/AVR Studio.
 *
 *  Note that this design currently has the following limitations:
 *    - No reversed/shorted target connector detection and notification
 *    - A separate header is required for each of the ISP, PDI and TPI programming protocols that the user wishes to use
 *
 *  On AVR models with an ADC converter, the USB AVR's AVCC pin should be tied to 5V (e.g. VBUS) and the
 *  \c VTARGET_ADC_CHANNEL token should be set to an appropriate ADC channel number in the project makefile for VTARGET
 *  detection to operate correctly. On models without an ADC converter, VTARGET will report a fixed 3.3V level at all times
 *  which should allow the programmer to remain compatible at the protocol level with all AVR devices.
 *
 *  While this application can be compiled for USB AVRs with as little as 8KB of FLASH, for full functionality 16KB or more
 *  of FLASH is required. On 8KB devices, ISP or PDI/TPI protocol programming support can be disabled to reduce program size.
 *
 *  \section Sec_KnownIssues Known Issues:
 *
 *  \par Incompatible with newer AVRDUDE releases.
 *  Due to <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?40831">a change in 6.0.1 and never AVRDUDE releases</a>,
 *  these builds are incompatible with the AVRISP-MKII clone project. Use an older 5.x release until AVRDUDE is patched.
 *
 *  \par XMEGA EEPROM programming fails in some cases.
 *  Several users have reported that XMEGA EEPROM programming fails unless the chip is erased first. If a non-blank EEPROM
 *  is present, writing further EEPROM data causes corruption.

 *
 *  \section Sec_Installation Installation
 *  The programmer supports multiple platforms, both Windows and Linux.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_LinuxInstallation Linux Installation
 *  On Linux systems, the programmer should be usable out of the box with no special setup other than (on some systems)
 *  editing of the system permissions to allow the programmer to be used from a non-elevated (root) context. The programmer
 *  is compatible with the free open source AVRDude programming software project.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_WindowsInstallation Windows Installation
 *  On Windows systems, due to an unfortunate limitation of the USB AVR devices and the driver used in the official AVR
 *  Studio/Atmel Studio platform, the programmer cannot be made compatible with AVRDude and AVR Studio/Atmel Studio at the
 *  same time. Instead, the programmer will be compatible with the official Atmel software by default, with a recompilation
 *  with the \c LIBUSB_DRIVER_COMPAT token (see \ref Sec_Options) being required to use the alternative libUSB driver
 *  compatibility mode that will allow the programmer to work under AVRDude on Windows.
 *
 *  If compiled for Atmel Studio/AVR Studio compatibility, install the Jungo device drivers that ship with the Atmel software.
 *  If compiled in the alternative libUSB compatibility mode for AVRDude use, install the libUSB drivers that are included
 *  with your compiled copy of AVRDude, or create them using the libUSB-Win32 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32)
 *  project.
 *
 *  For convenience, the programmer will report two different serial numbers depending on the firmware compatibility mode, so
 *  that the correct driver can be installed for the matching firmware. If the \c RESET_TOGGLES_LIBUSB_COMPAT compile option
 *  is used (see \ref Sec_Options) this allows for an easy way to automatically switch device drivers along with the firmware
 *  compatibility mode. The serials are:

 *
 *  In addition, the AVR's OCR1A pin will generate a 4MHz clock, to act as an external rescue device clock if the
 *  fuses have been mis-set. To use the recovery clock, connect the OCR1A pin of the USB AVR to the target AVR's
 *  XTAL1 pin, and set the ISP programming speed to 125KHz (note: other ISP speeds will not work correctly).
