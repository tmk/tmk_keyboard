 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  MIDI note synthesiser project. This project implements a basic DDS frequency synthesiser, capable of producing 8-bit PWM sine
 *  waves of variable frequency. When attached to a USB host, this project will allow for multiple MIDI notes to be synthesised into
 *  audiable sound via PWM, using the notes sent to MIDI channel 1.
 *
 *  Outgoing audio will output in 8-bit PWM onto the timer 3 output compare channel A. Decouple the audio output with a capacitor
 *  and attach to a speaker to hear the audio.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this project, which can control the project behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <th><b>Define Name:</b></th>
 *    <th><b>Location:</b></th>
 *    <th><b>Description:</b></th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>MAX_SIMULTANEOUS_NOTES</td>
 *    <td>AppConfig.h</td>
 *    <td>Sets the maximum number of MIDI notes that can be generated simultaneously. More notes require more processing time,
 *        and thus a value that is too high will cause audiable sound distortion due to insufficient CPU time.</td>
 *   </tr>
