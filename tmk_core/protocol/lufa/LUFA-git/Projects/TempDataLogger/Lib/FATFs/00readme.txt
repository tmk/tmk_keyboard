FILES

  ffconf.h   Configuration file for FatFs module.
  ff.h       Common include file for FatFs and application module.
  ff.c       FatFs module.
  diskio.h   Common include file for FatFs and disk I/O module.
  diskio.c   An example of glue function to attach existing disk I/O module to FatFs.
  integer.h  Integer type definitions for FatFs.
  option     Optional external functions.

  Low level disk I/O module is not included in this archive because the FatFs
  module is only a generic file system layer and not depend on any specific
  storage device. You have to provide a low level disk I/O module that written
  to control your storage device.
