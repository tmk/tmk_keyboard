 *
 *  The LUFA library is currently released under the MIT license, included below.
 *
 *  \section Sec_LicenseForHumans License Summary for Human Beings
 *  Everyone is free to use LUFA without payment - even in commercial applications
 *  where the product source code is not publicly disclosed. However, use of the
 *  library must be in accordance with the library license conditions.
 *
 *  If you wish to use LUFA without payment, you <b>must</b> include a copy of the
 *  full license text below with your product or project - on your website, and in
 *  an accompanying manual or other materials for the product. As long as the entire
 *  license text is made available and obvious to the users of your product, you
 *  are free to incorporate the LUFA library into your product without special
 *  additional licensing.
 *
 *  \section Sec_CommercialLicenses Commercial Licensing
 *  In some instances the small requirement for public disclosure of LUFA within a
 *  product is unwanted; in these instances a commercial license is offered up as an
 *  alternative to the standard LUFA license.
 *
 *  Commercial entities can opt out of the public disclosure clause in this license
 *  for a one-time US$1500 payment. This provides a non-exclusive modified MIT
 *  licensed which allows for the free use of the LUFA library, bootloaders and
 *  (where the sole copyright is attributed to Dean Camera) demos without public
 *  disclosure within an organization, in addition to three free hours of consultation
 *  with the library author, and priority support.
 *
 *  Please visit the Commercial License link on \ref Page_Resources for more information on
 *  ordering a commercial license for your company.
