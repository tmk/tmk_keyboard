/** \page Page_WritingBoardDrivers Writing LUFA Board Drivers
 *
 *  LUFA ships with several basic pre-made board drivers, to control hardware present on the supported board
 *  hardware - such as Dataflash ICs, LEDs, Joysticks, or other hardware peripherals. When compiling an application
 *  which makes use of one or more board drivers located in <i>LUFA/Drivers/Board</i>, you must also indicate which
 *  board hardware you are using in your project makefile. This is done by defining the <tt>BOARD</tt> macro using
 *  the <tt>-D</tt> switch passed to the compiler, with a constant of <tt>BOARD_{Name}</tt>. For example,
 *  <tt>-DBOARD=BOARD_USBKEY</tt> instructs the compiler to use the USBKEY board hardware drivers.
 *
 *  If your application does not use <i>any</i> board level drivers, you can omit the definition of the <tt>BOARD</tt>
 *  macro. However, some users may wish to write their own custom board hardware drivers which are to remain compatible
 *  with the LUFA hardware API. To do this, the <tt>BOARD</tt> macro should be defined to the value <tt>BOARD_USER</tt>.
 *  This indicates that the board level drivers should be located in a folder named "Board" located inside the
 *  application's folder.
 *
 *  When used, the driver stub files located in the <tt>LUFA/CodeTemplates/DriverStubs</tt> folder should be copied to
 *  the user application's <tt>Board/</tt> directory, and filled out to include the values and code needed to control
 *  the custom board hardware. Once done, the existing LUFA board level APIs (accessed in the regular
 *  <tt>LUFA/Drivers/Board/</tt> folder) will redirect to the user board drivers, maintaining code compatibility and
 *  allowing for a different board to be selected through the project makefile with no code changes.
