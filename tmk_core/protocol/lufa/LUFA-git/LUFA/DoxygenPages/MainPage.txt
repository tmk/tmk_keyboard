 *
 *  LUFA is an open-source USB library for the USB-enabled AVR microcontrollers, released under the MIT license (see \ref Page_LicenseInfo).
 *  It supports a large number of USB AVR models and boards (see \ref Page_DeviceSupport). It is designed to provide an easy to use,
 *  feature rich framework for the development of USB peripherals and hosts.
 *
 *  LUFA focuses on the microcontroller side of USB development only; it includes no PC host USB driver development facilities - other projects
 *  such as the Windows Driver Development Kit, Windows USB Device Mode Framework and libusb may be of interest for developing custom OS drivers.
 *  While custom USB devices can be made with LUFA using such tools, the included demos all use the inbuilt OS drivers for each USB class for
 *  simplicity.
 *
 *  The library is currently in a stable release, suitable for download and incorporation into user projects for
 *  both host and device modes. For information about the project progression, see the blog link at \ref Page_Resources.
 *
 *  LUFA is written specifically for the free AVR-GCC compiler, and uses several GCC-only extensions to make the
 *  library API more streamlined and robust. You can download AVR-GCC for free in a convenient windows package,
 *  from the the WinAVR website (see \ref Page_Resources).
 *
 *  The only required AVR peripherals for LUFA is the USB controller itself and interrupts - LUFA does not require the use of the
 *  microcontroller's timers or other hardware, leaving more hardware to the application developer.
 *
 *  Accompanying LUFA in the download package is a set of example demo applications, plus several Bootloaders of different classes
 *  and open source LUFA powered projects.
