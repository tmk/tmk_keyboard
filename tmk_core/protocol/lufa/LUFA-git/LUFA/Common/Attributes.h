 *  \brief Special function/variable attribute macros.
 *
 *  This module contains macros for applying specific attributes to functions and variables to control various
 *  optimizer and code generation features of the compiler. Attributes may be placed in the function prototype
 *  or variable declaration in any order, and multiple attributes can be specified for a single item via a space
 *  separated list.
 *
 *  On incompatible versions of GCC or on other compilers, these macros evaluate to nothing unless they are
 *  critical to the code's function and thus must throw a compile error when used.
