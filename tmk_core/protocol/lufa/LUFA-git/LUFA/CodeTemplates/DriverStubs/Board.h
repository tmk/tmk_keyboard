 *  \brief LUFA Custom Board Hardware Information Driver (Template)
 *
 *  This is a stub driver header file, for implementing custom board
 *  layout hardware with compatible LUFA board specific drivers. If
 *  the library is configured to use the BOARD_USER board mode, this
 *  driver file should be completed and copied into the "/Board/" folder
 *  inside the application's folder.
 *
 *  This stub is for the board-specific component of the LUFA Board Hardware
 *  information driver.
