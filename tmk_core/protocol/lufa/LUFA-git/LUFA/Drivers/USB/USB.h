 *  consists of many submodules, and is designed to provide an easy way to configure and control USB host, device
 *  or OTG mode USB applications.
 *
 *  The USB stack requires the sole control over the USB controller in the microcontroller only; i.e. it does not
 *  require any additional timers or other peripherals to operate. This ensures that the USB stack requires as few
 *  resources as possible.
 *
 *  The USB stack can be used in Device Mode for connections to USB Hosts (see \ref Group_Device), in Host mode for
 *  hosting of other USB devices (see \ref Group_Host), or as a dual role device which can either act as a USB host
 *  or device depending on what peripheral is connected (see \ref Group_OTG). Both modes also require a common set
 *  of USB management functions found \ref Group_USBManagement.

/** \defgroup Group_USBClassDrivers USB Class Drivers
 *
 *  \brief Drivers for the various standardized USB device classes
 *
 *  Drivers for both host and device mode of the standard USB classes, for rapid application development.
 *  Class drivers give a framework which sits on top of the low level library API, allowing for standard
 *  USB classes to be implemented in a project with minimal user code. These drivers can be used in
 *  conjunction with the library low level APIs to implement interfaces both via the class drivers and via
 *  the standard library APIs.
 *
 *  Multiple device mode class drivers can be used within a project, including multiple instances of the
 *  same class driver. In this way, USB Hosts and Devices can be made quickly using the internal class drivers
 *  so that more time and effort can be put into the end application instead of the USB protocol.
 *
 *  The available class drivers and their modes are listed below.

 *  \section Sec_USB_UsingClassDrivers Using the Class Drivers
 *  To make the Class drivers easy to integrate into a user application, they all implement a standardized
 *  design with similarly named/used function, enums, defines and types. The two different modes are implemented
 *  slightly differently, and thus will be explained separately. For information on a specific class driver, read
 *  the class driver's module documentation.
 *
 *  \subsection Sec_USB_ClassDriverDevice Device Mode Class Drivers
 *  Implementing a Device Mode Class Driver in a user application requires a number of steps to be followed. Firstly,
 *  the module configuration and state structure must be added to the project source. These structures are named in a
 *  similar manner between classes, that of <tt>USB_ClassInfo_<i>{Class Name}</i>_Device_t</tt>, and are used to hold the
 *  complete state and configuration for each class instance. Multiple class instances is where the power of the class
 *  drivers lie; multiple interfaces of the same class simply require more instances of the Class Driver's \c USB_ClassInfo_*
 *  structure.
 *
 *  Inside the ClassInfo structure lies two sections, a \c Config section, and a \c State section. The \c Config
 *  section contains the instance's configuration parameters, and <b>must have all fields set by the user application</b>
 *  before the class driver is used. Each Device mode Class driver typically contains a set of configuration parameters
 *  for the endpoint size/number of the associated logical USB interface, plus any class-specific configuration parameters.
 *
 *  The following is an example of a properly initialized instance of the Audio Class Driver structure:
 *
 *  \code
 *  USB_ClassInfo_Audio_Device_t My_Audio_Interface =
 *  {
 *      .Config =
 *          {
 *              .StreamingInterfaceNumber = 1,
 *              .DataINEndpoint           =
 *                  {
 *                      .Address          = (ENDPOINT_DIR_IN | 1),
 *                      .Size             = 64,
 *                      .Banks            = 1,
 *                  },
 *          },
 *  };
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  \note The class driver's configuration parameters should match those used in the device's descriptors that are
 *  sent to the host.
 *
 *  To initialize the Class driver instance, the driver's <tt><i>{Class Name}</i>_Device_ConfigureEndpoints()</tt> function
 *  should be called in response to the \ref EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged() event. This function will return a
 *  boolean true value if the driver successfully initialized the instance. Like all the class driver functions, this function
 *  takes in the address of the specific instance you wish to initialize - in this manner, multiple separate instances of
 *  the same class type can be initialized like this:
 *
 *  \code
 *  void EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged(void)
 *  {
 *      LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_READY);
 *
 *      if (!(Audio_Device_ConfigureEndpoints(&My_Audio_Interface)))
 *          LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_ERROR);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  Once initialized, it is important to maintain the class driver's state by repeatedly calling the Class Driver's
 *  <tt><i>{Class Name}</i>_Device_USBTask()</tt> function in the main program loop. The exact implementation of this
 *  function varies between class drivers, and can be used for any internal class driver purpose to maintain each
 *  instance. Again, this function uses the address of the instance to operate on, and thus needs to be called for each
 *  separate instance, just like the main USB maintenance routine \ref USB_USBTask():
 *
 *  \code
 *  int main(void)
 *  {
 *      SetupHardware();
 *
 *      LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_NOTREADY);
 *
 *      for (;;)
 *      {
 *          if (USB_DeviceState != DEVICE_STATE_Configured)
 *            Create_And_Process_Samples();
 *
 *          Audio_Device_USBTask(&My_Audio_Interface);
 *          USB_USBTask();
 *      }
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  The final standardized Device Class Driver function is the Control Request handler function
 *  <tt><i>{Class Name}</i>_Device_ProcessControlRequest()</tt>, which should be called when the
 *  \ref EVENT_USB_Device_ControlRequest() event fires. This function should also be called for
 *  each class driver instance, using the address of the instance to operate on as the function's
 *  parameter. The request handler will abort if it is determined that the current request is not
 *  targeted at the given class driver instance, thus these methods can safely be called
 *  one-after-another in the event handler with no form of error checking:
 *
 *  \code
 *  void EVENT_USB_Device_ControlRequest(void)
 *  {
 *      Audio_Device_ProcessControlRequest(&My_Audio_Interface);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  Each class driver may also define a set of callback functions (which are prefixed by \c CALLBACK_*
 *  in the function's name) which <b>must</b> also be added to the user application - refer to each
 *  individual class driver's documentation for mandatory callbacks. In addition, each class driver may
 *  also define a set of events (identifiable by their prefix of \c EVENT_* in the function's name), which
 *  the user application <b>may</b> choose to implement, or ignore if not needed.
 *
 *  The individual Device Mode Class Driver documentation contains more information on the non-standardized,
 *  class-specific functions which the user application can then use on the driver instances, such as data
 *  read and write routines. See each driver's individual documentation for more information on the
 *  class-specific functions.
 *
 *  \subsection Sec_USB_ClassDriverHost Host Mode Class Drivers
 *  Implementing a Host Mode Class Driver in a user application requires a number of steps to be followed. Firstly,
 *  the module configuration and state structure must be added to the project source. These structures are named in a
 *  similar manner between classes, that of <tt>USB_ClassInfo_<b>{Class Name}</b>_Host_t</tt>, and are used to hold the
 *  complete state and configuration for each class instance. Multiple class instances is where the power of the class
 *  drivers lie; multiple interfaces of the same class simply require more instances of the Class Driver's \c USB_ClassInfo_*
 *  structure.
 *
 *  Inside the \c USB_ClassInfo_* structure lies two sections, a \c Config section, and a \c State section. The \c Config
 *  section contains the instance's configuration parameters, and <b>must have all fields set by the user application</b>
 *  before the class driver is used. Each Device mode Class driver typically contains a set of configuration parameters
 *  for the endpoint size/number of the associated logical USB interface, plus any class-specific configuration parameters.
 *
 *  The following is an example of a properly initialized instance of the MIDI Host Class Driver structure:
 *
 *  \code
 *  USB_ClassInfo_MIDI_Host_t My_MIDI_Interface =
 *  {
 *      .Config =
 *          {
 *              .DataINPipe             =
 *                  {
 *                      .Address        = (PIPE_DIR_IN  | 1),
 *                      .Size           = 64,
 *                      .Banks          = 1,
 *                  },
 *              .DataOUTPipe            =
 *                  {
 *                      .Address        = (PIPE_DIR_OUT | 2),
 *                      .Size           = 64,
 *                      .Banks          = 1,
 *                  },
 *          },
 *  };
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  To initialize the Class driver instance, the driver's <tt><b>{Class Name}</b>_Host_ConfigurePipes()</tt> function
 *  should be called in response to the \c EVENT_USB_Host_DeviceEnumerationComplete() event firing. This function will
 *  will return an error code from the class driver's <tt><b>{Class Name}</b>_EnumerationFailure_ErrorCodes_t</tt> enum
 *  to indicate if the driver successfully initialized the instance and bound it to an interface in the attached device.
 *  Like all the class driver functions, this function takes in the address of the specific instance you wish to initialize -
 *  in this manner, multiple separate instances of the same class type can be initialized. A fragment of a Class Driver
 *  based Host mode application may look like the following:
 *
 *  \code
 *  void EVENT_USB_Host_DeviceEnumerationComplete(void)
 *  {
 *      LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_ENUMERATING);
 *
 *      uint16_t ConfigDescriptorSize;
 *      uint8_t  ConfigDescriptorData[512];
 *
 *      if (USB_Host_GetDeviceConfigDescriptor(1, &ConfigDescriptorSize, ConfigDescriptorData,
 *                                             sizeof(ConfigDescriptorData)) != HOST_GETCONFIG_Successful)
 *      {
 *          LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_ERROR);
 *          return;
 *      }
 *
 *      if (MIDI_Host_ConfigurePipes(&Keyboard_MIDI_Interface,
 *                                   ConfigDescriptorSize, ConfigDescriptorData) != MIDI_ENUMERROR_NoError)
 *      {
 *          LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_ERROR);
 *          return;
 *      }
 *
 *      if (USB_Host_SetDeviceConfiguration(1) != HOST_SENDCONTROL_Successful)
 *      {
 *          LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_ERROR);
 *          return;
 *      }
 *
 *      LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_READY);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  Note that the function also requires the device's configuration descriptor so that it can determine which interface
 *  in the device to bind to - this can be retrieved as shown in the above fragment using the
 *  \ref USB_Host_GetDeviceConfigDescriptor() function. If the device does not implement the interface the class driver
 *  is looking for, if all the matching interfaces are already bound to class driver instances or if an error occurs while
 *  binding to a device interface (for example, a device endpoint bank larger that the maximum supported bank size is used)
 *  the configuration will fail.
 *
 *  To complete the device enumeration after binding the host mode Class Drivers to the attached device, a call to
 *  \c USB_Host_SetDeviceConfiguration() must be made. If the device configuration is not set within the
 *  \c EVENT_USB_Host_DeviceEnumerationComplete() event, the host still will assume the device enumeration has failed.
 *
 *  Once initialized, it is important to maintain the class driver's state by repeatedly calling the Class Driver's
 *  <tt><b>{Class Name}</b>_Host_USBTask()</tt> function in the main program loop. The exact implementation of this
 *  function varies between class drivers, and can be used for any internal class driver purpose to maintain each
 *  instance. Again, this function uses the address of the instance to operate on, and thus needs to be called for each
 *  separate instance, just like the main USB maintenance routine \ref USB_USBTask():
 *
 *  \code
 *  int main(void)
 *  {
 *      SetupHardware();
 *
 *      LEDs_SetAllLEDs(LEDMASK_USB_NOTREADY);
 *
 *      for (;;)
 *      {
 *          if (USB_HostState != HOST_STATE_Configured)
 *              Create_And_Process_Samples();
 *
 *          MIDI_Host_USBTask(&My_Audio_Interface);
 *          USB_USBTask();
 *      }
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  Each class driver may also define a set of callback functions (which are prefixed by \c CALLBACK_*
 *  in the function's name) which <b>must</b> also be added to the user application - refer to each
 *  individual class driver's documentation for mandatory callbacks. In addition, each class driver may
 *  also define a set of events (identifiable by their prefix of \c EVENT_* in the function's name), which
 *  the user application <b>may</b> choose to implement, or ignore if not needed.
 *
 *  The individual Host Mode Class Driver documentation contains more information on the non-standardized,
 *  class-specific functions which the user application can then use on the driver instances, such as data
 *  read and write routines. See each driver's individual documentation for more information on the
 *  class-specific functions.
