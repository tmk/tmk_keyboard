 *  \brief USB class driver for the USB-IF Human Interface Device (HID) class standard.
 *
 *  \section Sec_USBClassHID_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Device/HIDClassDevice.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Host/HIDClassHost.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Host/HIDParser.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USB)</i>
 *
 *  \section Sec_USBClassHID_ModDescription Module Description
 *  HID Class Driver module. This module contains an internal implementation of the USB HID Class, for both Device
 *  and Host USB modes. User applications can use this class driver instead of implementing the HID class manually
 *  via the low-level LUFA APIs.
 *
 *  This module is designed to simplify the user code by exposing only the required interface needed to interface with
 *  Hosts or Devices using the USB HID Class.
