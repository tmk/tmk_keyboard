 *  \brief USB class driver for the Google Android Open Accessory class standard.
 *
 *  \section Sec_USBClassAOA_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Host/AndroidAccessoryClassHost.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *
 *  \section Sec_USBClassAOA_ModDescription Module Description
 *  Android Open Accessory Class Driver module. This module contains an internal implementation of the USB Android Open Accessory
 *  Class, for Host USB mode. User applications can use this class driver instead of implementing the Android Open Accessory Class
 *  manually via the low-level LUFA APIs.
 *
 *  This module is designed to simplify the user code by exposing only the required interface needed to interface with
 *  Host using the USB Android Open Accessory Class.
