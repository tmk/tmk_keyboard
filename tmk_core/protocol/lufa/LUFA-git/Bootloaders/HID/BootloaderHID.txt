 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a HID Class device, allowing for device FLASH programming through
 *  the supplied command line software, which is a modified version of Paul's TeensyHID Command Line loader code
 *  from PJRC (used with permission). This bootloader is deliberately non-compatible with the proprietary PJRC
 *  HalfKay bootloader GUI; only the command line interface software accompanying this bootloader will work with it.
 *
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the AT90USB1287 with an 8KB bootloader section size, and will fit
 *  into 2KB of bootloader space for the Series 2 USB AVRs (ATMEGAxxU2, AT90USBxx2) or 4KB of bootloader space for
 *  all other models. If you wish to alter this size and/or change the AVR model, you will need to edit the MCU,
 *  FLASH_SIZE_KB and BOOT_SECTION_SIZE_KB values in the accompanying makefile.
 *
 *  \warning <b>THIS BOOTLOADER IS NOT SECURE.</b> Malicious entities can recover written data, even if the device
 *           lockbits are set.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Running Running the Bootloader
 *
 *  This bootloader is designed to be started via the HWB mechanism of the USB AVRs; ground the HWB pin (see device
 *  datasheet) then momentarily ground /RESET to start the bootloader. This assumes the HWBE fuse is set and the BOOTRST
 *  fuse is cleared.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Installation Driver Installation
 *
 *  This bootloader uses the HID class driver inbuilt into all modern operating systems, thus no additional drivers
 *  need to be supplied for correct operation.
 *
 *  \section Sec_HostApp Host Controller Application
 *
 *  Due to licensing issues, the supplied bootloader is compatible with the HalfKay bootloader protocol designed
 *  by PJRC, but is non-compatible with the cross-platform loader GUI. A modified version of the open source
 *  cross-platform TeensyLoader application is supplied, which can be compiled under most operating systems. The
 *  command-line loader application should remain compatible with genuine Teensy boards in addition to boards using
 *  this custom bootloader.
 *
 *  Once compiled, programs can be loaded into the AVR's FLASH memory through the following example command:
 *  \code
 *  hid_bootloader_cli -mmcu=at90usb1287 Mouse.hex
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  \section Sec_KnownIssues Known Issues:
 *
 *  \par After loading an application, it is not run automatically on startup.
 *  Some USB AVR boards ship with the BOOTRST fuse set, causing the bootloader
 *  to run automatically when the device is reset. In most cases, the BOOTRST
 *  fuse should be disabled and the HWBE fuse used instead to run the bootloader
 *  when needed.
 *
