# Processor frequency.
#   Normally the first thing your program should do is set the clock prescaler,
#   so your program will run at the correct speed.  You should also set this
#   variable to same clock speed.  The _delay_ms() macro uses this, and many
#   examples use this variable to calculate timings.  Do not add a "UL" here.

# Input clock frequency.
#     This will define a symbol, F_USB, in all source code files equal to the
#     input clock frequency (before any prescaling is performed) in Hz. This value may
#     differ from F_CPU if prescaling is used on the latter, and is required as the
#     raw input clock is fed directly to the PLL sections of the AVR for high speed
#     clock generation for the USB and other AVR subsections. Do NOT tack on a 'UL'
#     at the end, this will be done automatically to create a 32-bit value in your
#     source code.
#
#     If no clock division is performed on the input clock inside the AVR (via the
#     CPU clock adjust registers or the clock division fuses), this will be equal to F_CPU.
