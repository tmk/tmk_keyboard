PC88(Late type) to USB keyboard protocol converter
=======================================
Target MCU is ATMega32u2 but other USB capable AVR will also work.


README FIRST
---------
This converter is for TYPE-B keyboard. For keyboards other than TYPE-B, 
change the mode switch on the back of the keyboard.

Stand the left foot on the back of the keyboard and there are two slits. 
There is a mode change switch in the back of it.

When this switch is up, TYPE-B mode is set.

When connecting a keyboard to this adapter, be sure to set to TYPE-B mode.



Connector
---------
On host/converter:

    5Pin mini DIN
       ___ ___
      /  |_|  \
     / 5     4 \
    | 3   |   2 |
     \_     1 _/
       \_____/
     (receptacle)


Wiring: You can change this with editing config.h.

    Pin mini DIN        MCU
    ----------------------------------
    1   5V              VCC
    2   GND             GND
    3   DATA            RD2
    4   NC
    5   NC




Protocol
--------
Signal: Asynchronous, Positive logic, 20800bps, Least bit first
Frame format: 1-Start bit(Lo), 8-Data bits, non-Parity, 1-Stop bit



Build Firmware
--------------
Just use 'make' to bild firmware for TMK PC88 converter.

    $ make -f Makefile.unimap clean
    $ make -f Makefile.unimap

To flash firmware

    $ make -f Makefile.unimap dfu

then push button on converter to flash firmware.

If you are using ATMega32u4 based board instead of premade TMK PC88 converter(ATMega32u2) use following commands.

    $ make -f Makefile.unimap.32u4 clean
    $ make -f Makefile.unimap.32u4
    $ make -f Makefile.unimap.32u4 dfu
