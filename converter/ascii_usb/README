ASCII to USB keyboard protocol converter
========================================
This converts serial console terminal into USB keyboard, tested with TRS-80 model 100 TELCOM application.
Target MCU is ATMega32u4 but other USB capable AVR will also work.


Hardware
--------
Connect RX, TX and GND to UART pin of AVR. Note that you may need line driver/level shifter like MAX232 to interface high voltage of RS-232C.



Build Firmware
--------------
Configure UART setting and Just use 'make'

    $ cd ascii_usb
    $ make

Then, load the binary to MCU with your favorite programmer.



Limitation
----------
- This cannot see key up event, you cannot hold a key.
- Alt, Gui(Win/Mac) modifier key are not available.



TRS-80 model 100
----------------
Use TELCOM program with setting: 19200bps/8bit/odd parity/1stop bit
To set this configuration push Stat(F3) and input '9801D,10'. Then push Term(F4) to connect.
