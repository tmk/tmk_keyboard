/** \page Page_WritingBoardDrivers Writing LUFA Board Drivers
 *
 *  LUFA ships with several basic pre-made board drivers, to control hardware present on the supported board
 *  hardware - such as Dataflash ICs, LEDs, Joysticks, or other hardware peripherals. When compiling an application
 *  which makes use of one or more board drivers located in LUFA/Drivers/Board, you must also indicate what board
 *  hardware you are using in your project makefile. This is done by defining the BOARD macro using the -D switch
 *  passed to the compiler, with a constant of BOARD_{Name}. For example <b>-DBOARD=BOARD_USBKEY</b> instructs the
 *  compiler to use the USBKEY board hardware drivers.
 *
 *  If your application does not use *any* board level drivers, you can omit the definition of the BOARD macro.
 *  However, some users may wish to write their own custom board hardware drivers which are to remain compatible
 *  with the LUFA hardware API. To do this, the BOARD macro should be defined to the value BOARD_USER. This indicates
 *  that the board level drivers should be located in a folder named "Board" located inside the application's folder.
 *
 *  When used, the driver stub files located in the LUFA/CodeTemplates/DriverStubs folder should be copied to the user
 *  Board/ directory, and fleshed out to include the values and code needed to control the custom board hardware. Once
 *  done, the existing LUFA board level APIs (accessed in the regular LUFA/Drivers/Board/ folder) will redirect to the
 *  user board drivers, maintaining code compatibility and allowing for a different board to be selected through the
 *  project makefile with no code changes.
