 *  Out of the box, LUFA contains a large number of pre-made class demos for you to test, experiment with and
 *  ultimately build upon for your own projects. All the demos (where possible) come pre-configured to build and
 *  run correctly on the AT90USB1287 AVR microcontroller, mounted on the Atmel USBKEY board and running at an 8MHz
 *  master clock. This is due to two reasons; one, it is the hardware the author possesses, and two, it is the most
 *  popular Atmel USB demonstration board to date. To learn how to reconfigure, recompile and program the included
 *  LUFA applications using different settings, see the subsections below.
 *
 *  Most of the included demos in the /Demos/ folder come in both ClassDriver and LowLevel varieties. If you are new
 *  to LUFA, it is highly recommended that you look at the ClassDriver versions first, which use the pre-made USB
 *  Class Drivers (\ref Group_USBClassDrivers) to simplify the use of the standard USB classes in user applications.
