 *  User code should include this file, which will in turn include the correct joystick driver header file for the
 *  currently selected board.
 *
 *  If the \c BOARD value is set to \c BOARD_USER, this will include the \c /Board/Joystick.h file in the user project

 *  \section Sec_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - None
 *
 *  \section Sec_ModDescription Module Description
 *  Hardware Joystick driver. This module provides an easy to use interface to control the hardware digital Joystick
 *  located on many boards.
 *
 *  If the \c BOARD value is set to \c BOARD_USER, this will include the \c /Board/Joystick.h file in the user project
 *  directory. Otherwise, it will include the appropriate built in board driver header file.
 *
 *  For possible \c BOARD makefile values, see \ref Group_BoardTypes.
 *
 *  \section Sec_ExampleUsage Example Usage
 *  The following snippet is an example of how this module may be used within a typical
 *  application.
 *
 *  \code
 *      // Initialize the board Joystick driver before first use
 *      Joystick_Init();
 *      
 *      printf("Waiting for joystick movement...\r\n");
 *      
 *      // Loop until a the joystick has been moved
 *      uint8_t JoystickMovement;
 *      while (!(JoystickMovement = Joystick_GetStatus())) {};
 *      
 *      // Display which direction the joystick was moved in
 *      printf("Joystick moved:\r\n");
 *      
 *      if (JoystickMovement & (JOY_UP | JOY_DOWN))
 *        printf("%s ", (JoystickMovement & JOY_UP) ? "Up" : "Down");
 *      
 *      if (JoystickMovement & (JOY_LEFT | JOY_RIGHT))
 *        printf("%s ", (JoystickMovement & JOY_LEFT) ? "Left" : "Right");
 *      
 *      if (JoystickMovement & JOY_PRESS)
