 *  \brief NTC Temperature Sensor board hardware driver.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/Board/Temperature.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_TEMPERATURE)</i>
 *
 *  \section Sec_ModDescription Module Description
 *  Temperature sensor driver. This provides an easy to use interface for the hardware temperature sensor located
 *  on many boards. It provides an interface to configure the sensor and appropriate ADC channel, plus read out the
 *  current temperature in degrees C. It is designed for and will only work with the temperature sensor located on the
 *  official Atmel USB AVR boards, as each sensor has different characteristics.
 *
 *  \section Sec_ExampleUsage Example Usage
 *  The following snippet is an example of how this module may be used within a typical
 *  application.
 *
 *  \code
 *      // Initialize the ADC and board temperature sensor drivers before first use
 *      ADC_Init(ADC_FREE_RUNNING | ADC_PRESCALE_128);
 *      Temperature_Init();
 *      
 *      // Display converted temperature in degrees Celsius
 *      printf("Current Temperature: %d Degrees\r\n", Temperature_GetTemperature());
 *  \endcode
