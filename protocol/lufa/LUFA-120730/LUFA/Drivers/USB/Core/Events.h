 *  \brief USB Event management definitions.
 *
 *  This module contains macros and functions relating to the management of library events, which are small
 *  pieces of code similar to ISRs which are run when a given condition is met. Each event can be fired from
 *  multiple places in the user or library code, which may or may not be inside an ISR, thus each handler
 *  should be written to be as small and fast as possible to prevent possible problems.
 *
 *  Events can be hooked by the user application by declaring a handler function with the same name and parameters
 *  listed here. If an event with no user-associated handler is fired within the library, it by default maps to an
 *  internal empty stub function.
 *
 *  Each event must only have one associated event handler, but can be raised by multiple sources by calling the
 *  event handler function (with any required event parameters).
