 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Device/MIDIClassDevice.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Host/MIDIClassHost.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *
 *  \section Sec_ModDescription Module Description
 *  MIDI Class Driver module. This module contains an internal implementation of the USB MIDI Class, for both Device
 *  and Host USB modes. User applications can use this class driver instead of implementing the MIDI class manually
 *  via the low-level LUFA APIs.
 *
 *  This module is designed to simplify the user code by exposing only the required interface needed to interface with
 *  Hosts or Devices using the USB MIDI Class.
 *
 *  \note The USB MIDI class is actually a special case of the regular Audio class, thus this module depends on
 *        structure definitions from the \ref Group_USBClassAudioDevice class driver module.
