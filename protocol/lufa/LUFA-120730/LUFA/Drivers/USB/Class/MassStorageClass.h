 *  Master include file for the library USB Mass Storage Class driver, for both host and device modes, where available.

 *  This file should be included in all user projects making use of this optional class driver, instead of
 *  including any headers in the USB/ClassDriver/Device, USB/ClassDriver/Host or USB/ClassDriver/Common subdirectories.

 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Device/MassStorageClassDevice.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Host/MassStorageClassHost.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *
 *  \section Sec_ModDescription Module Description
 *  Mass Storage Class Driver module. This module contains an internal implementation of the USB Mass Storage Class, for both
 *  Device and Host USB modes. User applications can use this class driver instead of implementing the Mass Storage class
 *  manually via the low-level LUFA APIs.
 *
 *  This module is designed to simplify the user code by exposing only the required interface needed to interface with
 *  Hosts or Devices using the USB Mass Storage Class.
