Fourway Sample Project
======================

This sample project shows how to configure a four button WASD keyboard.

This project implements a much more flexible `matrix.c` and most projects should not need to modify it.

While `matrix.c` is very flexible it is not a complete implementation.  The current implementation assumes the diodes in the switch matrix are wired on to the rows.  Attempts to change `DIODE_DIRECTION` will result in an error message.

The order of the structures in `config.h` are organized from the end user's point of view to controller configuration.

From the top to bottom we have:

* keyboard layout
* matrix layout
* controller configuration
* usb configuration

Keyboard Layout
---------------
Defines the physical layout of the keys.  See `usb_keycodes.h` for all `KB_*` codes.

Matrix Layout
-------------
Defines the pcb layout of the switches and how it maps to the logical layout.  Use `KB_NO` in the logial layout to mean there is not key at that logical position.

Controller Configuration
------------------------
Defines how the rows and cols in the logical layout are wired on to the Teensy 2.0 controller.  Use `NC` to mean not connected (see ports.h for all defines). The order of the rows and cols configured on to the Teensy does not matter.  The code will walk the rows and cols in the correct order.

Usb Configuration
-----------------
Defines usb metadata.

Implementation Details and Limitations
--------------------------------------
The rows in the matrix are connected to output pins while the cols are input pins.  The input is configured to be pulled up with a resistor, therefore reading 1 means the switch is open and 0 is the switch is closed.  This also means when the output is row is "turned on" it is shorted to ground to attempt to pull down the resistor.

The current implementation can only go up to 16 rows but it can be easily expanded to 64 rows with an `uint64_t`.

The controller is assumed to be a Teensy 2.0, but can easily be extended to use a Teensy 2.0+ to support even larger matrices.

Setting `DIODE_DIRECTION` to `COLS` is not implemented but this can be worked around by transposing both the keyboard layout and matrix layouts in config.h.

To debug `matrix.c` uncomment two lines in `matrix_init`.  This will add an init delay of 1 second and print debug messages which are readable using hid_listen.  Also adding a delay of 300ms (use `_delay_ms(300)`) in `matrix_scan` helps slows down the entire program to make the messages readable in real time.
